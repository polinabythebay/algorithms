This repo is dedicated not just to solving canonical computer science algorithms, but to understand: 

1. why these algorithms are important
1. various ways you can implement them across the following dimensions
  - programming languages
  - data structure choice
  - time/space trade offs
  - real world use cases

### What is an algorithm and why is it important

> "an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output." - CLRS

Some algorithms are intuitive and already a part of how we reason about things. However, it's valuable to study more complex algorithms because it leads to having building blocks for efficient/better problem solving. It's also valuable because we as programmers are resource constrained and efficient run time/space time algorithms can save companies a lot of money and it also allows us to some problems that would take forever to solve if it was done inefficiently. 

Chances are good that the problem you are trying to solve is similar to another problem in some respects that has already been solved by a particular algorithm class. By developing a good understanding of a large range of algorithms, you will be able to choose the right one for a problem and apply it properly.

Many toy problems, though they may not seem realistic, require the same set of algorithmic knowledge that comes up every day in the real world. It's also important to have an idea of what algorithms are used everyday in checking email/listening to music.
