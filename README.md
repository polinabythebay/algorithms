## Common computer science algorithms

This repo is dedicated not just to solving canonical computer science algorithms, but to understand: 

1. why these algorithms are important
1. various ways you can implement them across the following dimensions
  - programming languages
  - data structure choice
  - time/space trade offs
  - real world use cases
1. when to recognize an algorithm should be applied
1. when to recongize a variant of a common algorithm
